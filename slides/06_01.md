Hey there...this is Ray again. Thanks for watching.

If you want to learn more about Visual Studio code, I'd suggest going to their blog at code.visualstudio.com/blogs. They have super detailed documentation for all the features.
One other thing I never miss is the VSCode Release parties, where you can learn about the latest features and new releases and interact with some of the developers of Visual Studio Code. Their YouTube Channel is at yotube.com/code.
If you want to know what I'm up to follow me on LinkedIn I have more than 50 other courses. check out my blog at raybo.org and keep up with me on any other social media network like YouTube or Twitter @planetoftheweb.

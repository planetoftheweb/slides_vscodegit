Visual Studio Code has it's own panel for keeping track of different logs, including Git Logs. That's a good place to see what the different visual commands are doing in Git.

## VS Code Logs

> >

To get to these logs, you can go to the View>Output menu, or switch to the output tab if your terminal is already showing.

To the right you'll see a dropdown, where you can choose the types of logs you want to see.

If you want to, you can use the icon next to the menu to clear the logs

You can also turn autoscrolling on/off, which can be a little annoying on very active logs.

You can also open the logs as files into the editor.

The log is a nice way to look at what's happening and I love the different options.

Copilot is a tool from GitHub that uses artificial intellingence to suggest code and write entire functions in real time.

There is a Visual Studio Code extension you can install, but before you do that, just note that this is not a free tool. It costs $100/a year or $10/per month.

Let's install the extension and see what it's about.

You can tell Copilot is running by looking at the status bar and looking for the copilot icon.

Let's go to the Command Palette and look at the commands available.

Now start writing some code like a loop, and you'll see that copilot is going to give you some recommendations.

You can also ask it to do some code for you through comments.

CoPilot is really smart and analyses the fact that I'm running different extensions and tries to give me code.

If you want to learn more about CoPilot, take this course from my friend Ronnie Sheer. It's a pretty cool addition to your GitHub tools.

The most common task after setting up your repository is learning to stage, commit and push. Let's take a look at how Visual Studio Code can help speed that up.

## Staging and Committing

The quickest way to stage an individual change is by using the gutter next to the text you're writing.

You can also pull up the command palette and really quickly stage changes from there. Because Visual Studio Code can be customize you can give this a command key combination.

One of the nice things about the command key combos is that you can add what's called a chord, so a startup command combination like command-k, which is pretty safe for custom commands and then add a letter, so you can make command-k s for staging and command-k c for committing.

The nice thing is that committing like this will automatically 
bring up a text editor where you can type your commit message.

There are also options to do an amend, which adds to your last commit. I think getting used to the command palette is probably the fastest way to get things done.

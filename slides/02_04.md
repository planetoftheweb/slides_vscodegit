The Explorer is what looks like a file view, where you can see the files that are in your current project. You can see a few hints regarding the files.

If you see a file with a U next to it, that's an untracked file. That's a file that's been created, but has not been added into Git.

If you see an A next to the file. That file has been added or staged, but not yet committed as a change.

An M means the file is already being tracked by Git and has been modified. Those Modifications are ready to be staged.

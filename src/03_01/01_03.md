# Installing Requirements

> >

## Learning Goal

To get the most out of VS Code and Git, you'll probably want to make sure you have a few things installed.

---

# Installations

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

> >

Of course, you're going to want to install Visual Studio Code into your system. You can get that at this URL. 

You will, naturally also need to make sure you have a copy of Git installed, which you can get here.

Finally, for most web projects you'll want a copy of NodeJS, which also install NPM, the all important Node Package Manager.

# Installing Requirements

If you're used to using other terminals, it's a good idea to install the code command, it allows you to quickly open files with Visual Studio Code using the Code prefix

# Installations

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

# Learning Goal

# Script
The first thing I always do when I install Visual Studio code into a new computer, is to install the code shell command. This allows me to call the terminal inside VSCode from within my other terminals and easily call up folders.

Installing the code command modifies my path and lets me quickly open up a project inside visual studio code.

The easiest way to do this is to use the command palette and start typing shell. This will pull up the shell command options and you can choose to install and uninstall.

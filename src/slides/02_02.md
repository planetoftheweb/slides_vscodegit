Another common way to get to Git commands is through the command palette. Once you access that menu, you'll be able to perform just about any git or GitHub command you may need. A lot of other features use this command to execute.

## Superior Commit

If you pull up the command palette you'll see a list of all of the commands you can use with Visual Studio Code.

If you type Git, you can see the list of Git Commands. At first, it might not seem like this is any better than typing it in the terminal, but one way this is superior is by giving you a more interactive version of the command.

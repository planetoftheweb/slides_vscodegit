The editor is hands down where you spend most of your time in Visual Studio Code, it has some excellent version control features that you should be aware of.

In the editor you can see some information in the gutter. The gutter is the area between the line numbers if they're showing...to the left of the text.

If you see a green line, those are new lines that have been added to your document.

A blue line means a change on a current line.

A small red triangle, it means you've deleted something there.

The cool thing about this area is that it's interactive, so you can click on those bars or the triangle to open up the DIFF view. That makes it easier to roll things back.

From this view, you can stage an individual line by line change, revert it back and navigate through all the changes in the current document.

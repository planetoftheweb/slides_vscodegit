So if you want to add it. Go to your extensions panel, do a search for CodeSpaces and Install it.

Whereas most of GitHub is free, you get sixty hours for free for using CodeSpaces and then you get charged according to your usage.

Once you install that, take a look at the command palette and you'll see all types of commands.

You can also see an option to see your current codespaces if you have the Remote extension.

You'll need to have an account and be connected to CodeSpaces.

Before you go any further, I need you to create a new branch and make some changes, then commit something to that new branch. Just like you would in a project. I'll wait a second while you get that done before we continue.


What I've done is to create a branch called vite-update. This is an older project that used the gulp build tool and I wanted to create a pull request to allow others to comment on the addition before it gets merged back to main.

That's a classic use case for Pull Requests.

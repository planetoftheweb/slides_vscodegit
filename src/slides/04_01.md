Merge conflicts are a common problem when working with Git. They happen when two people make changes to the same file and then have to reconcile these changes.

## Merge Conflicts

Since we want to see how to work with them, we'll have to create a merge conflict ourselves. To do that, I'm going to change something in my repo using the GitHub website.

Solving merge conflicts isn't something that's considered, fun, but this is one place where Visual Studio Code has some superior capabilities to something like the terminal, so make sure you take the time to try this yourself.

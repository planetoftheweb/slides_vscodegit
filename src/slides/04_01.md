You can save yourself a lot of time by issuing Pull Requests directly in Visual Studio Code. When you don't have to leave the interface you can do everything you need inside VSCode without pulling up a browser.

Now that we've navigated through the whole interface, you've seen where you can do just about anything in VS Code. There's still a few things to point out.

You probably noticed I've been avoiding allowing Visual Studio Code to automatically do things like fetch and pull. It's a clear way to speed things up if when you commit, you can auto-stage, for example.

Those are also settings that you can turn on and off.

So, for example, there's a setting called autofetch that will let Visual Studio Code check every now and then to see if the remote repository has changed in any way.
